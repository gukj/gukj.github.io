# Beers & Beats
## What is Beers & Beats?
Beers & Beats is an application for people who like to listen to music while drinking beer. The intended user likes the combination of drinks and tunes so much, in fact, that he/she would like the music to match the beer.
## How do you use Beers & Beats?
The first thing you do is that you authorize the application with Spotify. After doing so, you can either search for beers or (go crazy and) use the 'Just get me a random beer!'-button (NOT for the faint hearted).
## How do you use it?
Go to the [API Tutorial](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/tutorial/) from Spotify to generate your `client_id`, `client_secret` and `redirect_url`.
After getting them, paste them on line 16 in the `app.js` file
## What now?
Drink beer and enjoy beats.
